                                         <p>Full name: Aoife Louise Katherine McManus</p>
                                         <p>Biography: Currently, I am 16, and I live in a small suburb in New York. I have a dog, three younger sisters, a mum and a dad.</p>
                                         <p>Likes: Books, pizza, rowing, literature, animals, winter, and christmas.</p>
                                  <p>Dislikes: Mice and rats, cranberry juice, bananas, and country music.</p>
                                  <p>Funfact: Since I was born, I have attended seven different schools.</p>
                                                                <p>Reflection (7/19/2017): Similarities between python and scratch were being able to use a variable to determine things like color and number of sides when making a shape. You were also able to repeat an action a specific number of times by using repeat in scratch and using a loop in python. Concerning differences, while in scratch, they have most of the commands ready to drag, in python, you have to memorize lines to write yourself. While I was debugging the program in python, the work seemed difficult. I had to convert some things from strings to integers. However, at the end, the result was very rewarding.</p>
